Hi Mehmet & World,

I have decided to also add a Graphql component in our project and ofcourse swagger api. I have to decide what comes first.
Also its a opportunity to increase the MongoDB complexity to create potential bottlenecks for load tesing. With a Rest Get Api its too easy.

So todos as follows

- Graphql api -> Does this have pork in it (menu:menuid)?
- MongoDB MongoDB Lookup Aggregation implementation
- Dockerize whole app
- Create a pipeline
- Add more JMETER test cases
- Add JMETER results listeners
